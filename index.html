                            We plan to make an easy but interesting game which can be played when the player is taking the subway or waiting for someone. Therefore, we came up with a game background story and mechanics.
                        </p>

                            The player's mission is to take control of Voltorias most valuable weapon and protect the planet from the soldiers of the evil empire of Ohm who seeks out to destroy it.

                            The player has a limited energy bar to generate current, each time the player press terminals to generate electric current, the energy bar will be consumed.
                            Player also need to eat voltage to gain energy, if the energy is used up, the player will not be able to generate current. If there are five-ohm enemies invading the planet Voltoria, then the game ends.

                            The player uses 2 fingers to press the terminal so that it can generate an electric arc.
                            In order to make the game more interesting and keep the player moving or using fingers, I came up with the following function:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When players double-click on two terminals, it will generate a line to bounce off the enemy. If the bounce-off enemy collides with the falling enemy, both of them will explode.

                        </p>
                        <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/TwoMethod.png" alt="" /></a>
                        <p>
                            After a group discussion, we thought that this function will make the game too difficult to play, so we may not implement it.

                        <p>
                            Our first advertising mode is that the player needs to watch five-second ADs after game over.
                            However, this mode has a high risk, that is, the player has a large possibility to close the game and do not want to playing the game again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, I proposed a different type of terminal. When the player dies, a “Gain one life” window will pop up, the player has two choices, that is, “Yes” and “Skip”.
                            If the player selects “Skip” in the “Gain one life” window, then, game over. If the player chooses “Yes”, he needs to watch the 5-second advertisement, and he will get one life to continue the game after the advertisement ends.
                            The player only gains one extra life when he died, which means if the player died again, there is no “Gain one life” window anymore. but if the player is dead again, then the game is over and there is no chance of getting another chance.

                            During this group meeting, we decide to have three different types of enemies and three levels of electric arc. We will have green (easy enemy), blue (normal enemy) and red (hard enemy).
                            There will be a threshold for how close the terminals can be to generate each level of electric arc. Green arc is the easiest, when the player put fingers the farthest from each other.
                            Blue is middle distance, red is close distance.
                            Each level of electric arc can only kill correspond level of enemies, which can make the game more difficult and fun.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We decide to have power ups, and enemies will go faster as time goes by. At the 3 minutes mark, enemy spawn frequency and enemy travel speed reach a limit, which is to be quite challenging.

                        <p>
                            The player’s terminal points can not be raised above a certain level on the screen.

                        <p>
                            A score marker should be placed on the top of the screen, to show player points, 10 points for each eliminated enemy.

                        <p>

                            But the floatingtext is not presented when running the game, because the rotation is not correct, it covered by background.

                            Quaternions are generally represented in the form: A +bi +cj +dk
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, it is difficult to set desired rotation with Quaternion.Using quaternion to put an gameobject to a specific rotation requires a certain operation. Therefore, assigning quaternion directly is not a good choice.

                        <p>
                            Using quaternion.euler can transform the quaternions into Euler expressions. Then, assign (x, y, z) values to change the rotation of gameobject.

                            I made a “Game Over” animation in the unity, it will play straight away when you click the play button. But I want it play after player lose their life, so it is better to add a trigger in animation.
