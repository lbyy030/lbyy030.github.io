                            We plan to make an easy but interesting game which can be played when player are taking subway or waiting someone. Therefore, we came up with  game background story and mechanics.
                        </p>

                            The players mission is to take control of Voltorias most valuable weapon and protect the planet from the soldiers of the evil empire of Ohm who seeks out to destroy it.

                            The player have a limited energy bar to generate current, each time the player press terminals to generate electric current, the energy bar will consumed.
                            Player also need to eat voltage to gain energy, if the energy is used up, the player will not be able to generate current. If there are five ohm enemies invading the planet Voltoria, then the game ends.

                            The player uses 2 fingers to press the termina so that it can generate an electric arc.
                            In order to make the game more interesting and keep player moving or using finger, I came up with the fellowing function:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When players double-click on two terminals, it will generate a line to bounce off the enemy. If the bounce-off enemy collide with the falling enemy, both of them will explode.

                        </p>
                        <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/TwoMethod.jpg" alt="" /></a>
                        <p>
                            After a group discussion, we thought that this function will make the game too difficult to play, so we may not implement it.

                        <p>
                            Our first advertising mode is that the player need to watch five-second ADs after game over.
                            However, this mode has a high risk, that is, the player has large possibility to close the game and do not want to playing the game again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, I proposed a new advertising mode. When the player dies, a “Gain one life” window will pop up, the player has two choices, that is, “Yes” and “Skip”.
                            If the player selects “Skip” in the “Gain one life” window, then, game over. If the player chooses “Yes”, he need to watch the 5-second advertisement, and he will get one life to continue the game after the advertisement ends.
                            The player only gain one extra life when he died, which means if the player died again, there is no “Gain one life” window anymore. but if the player is dead again, then the game is over and there is no chance of getting another chance.

                            We decide to add positive feedback in game, so I made the word feedback prefab, which can be instantiated when the user gained lives or kill the enemies.
                            It should be presented at a fixed angle in a fixed position.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>· </strong> To instantiate prefab:
                        </p>
                        <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Code1.png" alt="" /></a>
                        <p>
                            But the floatingtext is not presented when running the game, because the rotation is not correct, it covered by background.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Quaternions are generally represented in the form: A +bi +cj +dk
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, it is difficult to set desired rotation with Quaternion.Using quaternion to put an gameobject to a specific rotation requires a certain operation. Therefore, assigning quaternion directly is not a good choice.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using quaternion.euler can transform the quaternions into Euler expressions. Then, assign (x, y, z) values to change the rotation of gameobject.
